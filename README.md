## Gene Expression and Clustering

This repository contains the work done as part of a sequence of assignments related to manipulating and analyzing gene expression data, under the Quantitative Biolgy Workshop conducted by MITx.

Contents of the repository:

- RNA-seq parsing: usage of reg-ex to parse an RNA-seq data file and extract gene expression levels corresponding to specified fields

- Patient prognosis: analysis of mRNA expression level data supplied from multiple tumour samples using correlation to identify genes likely to be linked with likelihood of survival, and a heatmap created to visualize the patient prognosis

- Cell clustering: transformation of normalized expression values and application of PCA to cluster cells in a population based on their gene expression profiles
